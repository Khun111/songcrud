# songcrud
My first django app from zuri training.

Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting data(CRUD).

Moving on to creating the models and relationships. . 
This progressed quite quickly. I successfully created a Django Rest Framework. Things moved on so fast that I forgot to udate this readme.
